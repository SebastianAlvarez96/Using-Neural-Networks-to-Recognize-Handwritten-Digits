# Using-Neural-Networks-to-Recognize-Handwritten-Digits
Exercise of chapter 1

On this repository, I would develop a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from MNIST dataset following the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen.
One can see the book and process on http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
